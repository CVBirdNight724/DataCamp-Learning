The Text Generation model is used for replicating a character's way of speech and will have some fun mimicking Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory. Neural Machine Translation is used for example by Google Translate in a much more complex model. In this chapter, you will create a model that translates Portuguese small phrases into English."
