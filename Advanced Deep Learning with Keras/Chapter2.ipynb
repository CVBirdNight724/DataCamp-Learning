    "# Two Input Networks Using Categorical Embeddings, Shared Layers, and Merge Layers\n",

    "In this chapter, you will build two-input networks that use categorical embeddings to represent high-cardinality data, shared layers to specify re-usable building blocks, and merge layers to join multiple inputs to a single output. By the end of this chapter, you will have the foundational building blocks for designing neural networks with complex data flows."
