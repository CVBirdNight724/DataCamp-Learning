    "In the final chapter, you'll use high-level APIs in TensorFlow 2 to train a sign language letter classifier. You will use both the sequential and functional Keras APIs to train, validate, make predictions with, and evaluate models. You will also learn how to use the Estimators API to streamline the model definition and training process, and to avoid errors."
