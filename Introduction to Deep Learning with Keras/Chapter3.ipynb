    "In the previous chapters, you've trained a lot of models! You will now learn how to interpret learning curves to understand your models as they train. You will also visualize the effects of activation functions, batch-sizes, and batch-normalization. Finally, you will learn how to perform automatic hyperparameter optimization to your Keras models using sklearn."
