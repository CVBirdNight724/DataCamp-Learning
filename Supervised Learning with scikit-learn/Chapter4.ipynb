For example, Sub-Saharan Africa has a lower life expectancy compared to Europe and Central Asia. Therefore, if you are trying to predict life expectancy, it would be preferable to retain the `'Region'` feature. To do this, you need to binarize it by creating dummy variables, which is what you will do in this exercise.\n",
